This blog will likely security concepts explained in an approachable manner, and much more.~~

I am an independent security researcher, Linux, open source and privacy enthusiastic. I started my career as just a software developer. In my first experiences with many web frontend and web backend programming languages and technologies, including Hapi.js, Express.js and NodeJS. And development of Ionic, Cordova + native Android & IOS mobile apps. I’m interested in applying my skills anywhere where I can. So, Afterwards, I decided to dedicate my career to InfoSec, focusing on penetration testing and security research. My day activities are deep diving into InfoSec, Coffee, Hack, Code, Read, Eat, Sleep && Repeat. Also, in my spare time to participate in bug bounties and perform freelance security research & practice RE and WAS. I play CTFs very often.
